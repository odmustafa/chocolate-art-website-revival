## Task

I need to recreate the old Chocolate and Art Show website. Previously, it was a Wordpress website. It recently went offline, so the only reference material available is found on the Wayback Machine archives of the website. 

I have linked to each page's wayback machine archive below. Please use this as reference material to recreate the website. 

## Requirements

When recreating the website, please use the following guidelines:

- Remain consistent with the original website's design and layout. This is the most important aspect of the task. This recreation will be a starting point for the next phase of this project, which is to update the website's content and include some more modern features (but don't worry about that for now, just focus on recreating the old website as faithfully as possible).  
- The website should be recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Choose the best tools and frameworks for the job. 
- The website should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile browsers. 
- The website should be accessible and meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. 
- The website should be optimized for performance and load quickly. 

## Pages

Here are the various pages of the old Chocolate and Art Show website, as archived by the Wayback Machine. Except for "index", the remaining links are located in the website footer when viewed on a desktop browser.
