# Chocolate & Art Show — Wayback Recreation

## Overview
This project recreates the former Chocolate & Art Show website using modern, modular assets, with the best frameworks and stack. The project is guided by the Wayback Machine archives of the site (which was originally built in WordPress). Links to the Wayback Machine snapshots are provided below in this README.
Using a modern stack, we can ensure that the site is accessible, performant, and easy to maintain.

## Goals - THESE ARE REQUIRED TO BE MET
- Recreate the site so that it is fully functional.
- The look and layout MUST remain as identical as possible.
- Keep it responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA-minded), and performant.
- Mobile first.
- Provide a clean structure for future content updates
- Utilize headless Wordpress to handle backend functions such as artist submission forms, contact forms, user account management, event listings, artist profiles.
- ADHERE TO ESTABLISHED SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT (KISS, DRY, YAGNI, etc. Additional information in the next section.)

## Software Design Principles
### Separation of Concerns:
- Frontend (UI) and Backend (API/Logic): Clearly distinguish between client-side rendering and server-side operations (API routes, server actions, data fetching).
- Component Structure: Organize React components by responsibility (e.g., presentational components, container components, UI elements).
- Data Layer: Centralize data fetching and state management logic, separating it from UI rendering.
### Modularity and Reusability:
- Reusable Components: Create generic, reusable UI components and utility functions.
- API Route Design: Design API routes with clear, specific functionalities to avoid monolithic endpoints.
- Server Actions: Leverage server actions for direct server-side logic execution, promoting reusability of server-side functions.
### Scalability and Performance:
- Data Fetching Strategy: Choose appropriate data fetching methods (SSR, SSG, ISR, client-side fetching) based on content and performance needs.
- Optimized Assets: Utilize Next.js's built-in image, font, and script optimizations.
- Database Optimization: Employ efficient database queries, indexing, and connection pooling.
### Maintainability and Readability:
- Code Organization: Establish a consistent and logical directory structure for components, pages, API routes, and utilities.
- Naming Conventions: Follow clear and consistent naming conventions for files, variables, and functions.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for both client-side and server-side operations.
### Security:
- Environment Variables: Securely manage sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) using environment variables.
- Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for protected routes and data.
- Input Validation: Validate user input on both the client and server sides to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Run locally
- `cd public`
- `python3 -m http.server 8080` (or use your preferred local server)
- Browse to http://localhost:8080

## Notes and approach
- Visual fidelity: We’re mirroring typography, colors, spacing, and structure from the archives.
- Assets: For now, background and hero images reference Wayback URLs. We can later download and store them in public/assets/img to improve reliability.
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, alt text, sufficient contrast, keyboard-friendly navigation, and reduced-motion considerations are applied. Further improvements welcome.
- Performance: carousel images optimized to WebP format (34% size reduction).

## Recommendations (future phase)
- Replace external Wayback links with local optimized assets.
- Enhance SEO (metadata, structured data) and analytics.
- Add web3 integration for ticketing and payments. (need to research more first)


## Deployment
Choose any static host. The site is fully static and lives under the `public/` directory.

- Netlify (recommended)
  1) New site from Git > pick this repo
  2) Build command: (leave empty)
  3) Publish directory: `public`
  4) Deploy. Optional: add a custom domain and enable HTTPS.

- Vercel
  1) New Project > Import Git Repository
  2) Framework preset: “Other”
  3) Output Directory: `public`
  4) No build command
  5) Deploy

- GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch via GitHub Actions)
  1) Settings > Pages > Build and deployment: “GitHub Actions”
  2) Add the workflow below at `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` (or similar)

  Example workflow (publishes the `public/` directory):

  name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pages: write
    id-token: write
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: Upload static site
          uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
          with:
            path: public
        - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
          uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

Notes
- No environment variables are required for the static site. In a future headless CMS phase, add secrets for API endpoints.
- All asset paths are relative (e.g., `assets/...`, `pages/...`), so hosting from the site root works out of the box.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions that keep the site faithful to the archived design and align with the software design principles above.

- Getting started
  - Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
  - Run locally from `public/`: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
- Coding standards
  - Keep markup semantic and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA-minded)
  - Reuse components/styles where possible (DRY/KISS/YAGNI)
  - Optimize images (prefer WebP); large hero images ~50vh, < 250–300KB when possible
  - Ensure keyboard navigation works and color contrast remains sufficient
- Commit/PR guidelines
  - Write clear commits (e.g., Conventional Commits style is encouraged)
  - Include before/after screenshots for visual changes
  - Avoid regressions in performance and accessibility
  - Open a PR to `main` and request review
